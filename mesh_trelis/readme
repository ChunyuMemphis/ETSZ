The code is run on mac using Trelis-16.1. 

If you use different version, it may cause some prolems. 

Please run line by line to check out the possible problem. 


The file "tilt_5055" is for journal code which produce 50-55km low density anomaly.

Similarly, the file " tilt_5080" is the code to produce 50-80km low density anomaly.


Thanks,
